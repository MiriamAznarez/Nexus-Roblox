Overview
--------
Nexus Roblox Executor is a lightweight executor built for Luau script execution. It targets users who run scripts in Roblox environments that rely on Luau. The project offers a free plan and a lifetime package. The app lives on a website with hosted downloads and an update channel through GitHub Releases. Users report stable runs and no bans tied to reported use. The executor focuses on a concise hub and a curated list of supported games.

The design favors clarity. The tool aims to stay small and focused. It runs common Luau hooks and offers a compact interface for loading, editing, and running scripts. The hub includes a small set of preconfigured game entries and a short list of utility scripts.

Key features
------------
- Luau runtime support for standard executors
- Free package and lifetime package options
- Small executor hub with curated game entries
- Hosted assets and releases via the website and GitHub
- Script editor with syntax highlighting for Luau
- File import and drag-and-drop support
- Basic API for hooking and module loading
- Session logs for script run traces
- Lightweight UI with a compact layout

What Nexus runs
---------------
Nexus targets Luau-based executors. It supports script formats used by common Roblox executor tools. The executor handles:

- Plain Luau scripts
- Script modules and modules with require patterns
- Standard Roblox APIs exposed to Luau
- Basic HTTP wrapper for web calls (subject to executor backend)
- Simple file loaders for local script files

Supported executor backends
- Synapse-like APIs that map to Luau
- Common Luau injection flows
- Standard memory-based executor hooks

Packages and hosting
--------------------
The project offers two main access models:
- Free package: a full-featured client with a few limitations in the hub and updates.
- Lifetime package: an unlocked client with hub access and priority updates.

All downloads and update artifacts publish to GitHub Releases and the website hosting. The releases page contains packaged builds, zipped clients, and helper tools. Download and run the file on the releases page to install or update Nexus. Use the Releases link to fetch the latest build: https://github.com/MiriamAznarez/Nexus-Roblox/releases

Manual paste:
- Paste the script text into the editor.
- Save if you want a local copy.
- Press Run to execute.

Script execution flow
1. Nexus parses the script.
2. Nexus prepares the execution environment.
3. The executor injects runtime hooks.
4. The script runs in the target process.
5. Console logs surface output and error traces.

Editor tips
- Use tabs to manage multiple files.
- Use the search box to find text across open scripts.
- Use the format function to align code style.
- Save files to keep them for later runs.

Integration with Luau Executors
-------------------------------
Nexus targets Luau runtime. It maps a set of common APIs expected by Luau-based scripts. Integration points include:

- require and module mapping:
  Nexus supports module loading paths that match common Luau patterns. The executor maps local module files into the runtime require table.
- game and workspace references:
  Nexus exposes the Roblox core globals expected by many scripts. The executor resolves known symbols and passes them to the script runtime.
- event hooks:
  Nexus supports basic event hooking that scripts use to react to game events.
- memory patching:
  Where allowed by the backend, Nexus uses in-memory patches to attach to a running process and inject code.

API compatibility notes
- Nexus aims to match common executor function names used in Luau scripts.
- If a script uses a rare or custom executor API, you may need to adapt the script or use a wrapper module.
- The built-in module loader can map alias names to local files.

Game support and hub
--------------------
Nexus ships with a small hub. The hub lists a limited number of games that include preconfigured attachment settings. The hub focuses on common entries and includes:

- Entry name and game ID
- Attachment method
- Script presets
- Quick run buttons

The hub keeps the list short to reduce clutter. You can add custom game entries with:
- Game name
- Place ID
- Attachment method
- Custom script presets

Add a game entry:
1. Open Hub.
2. Click Add.
3. Enter name and place ID.
4. Choose a default script.
5. Save.

The release builds may expand the hub with more entries over time.

Configuration and settings
--------------------------
Nexus provides a small settings panel. Key options:

- Startup options:
  - Auto-check updates on launch
  - Restore last session
- Editor:
  - Tab size
  - Theme: light or dark
  - Auto-indent
- Execution:
  - Default attach method
  - Thread priority for injected scripts
  - Logging verbosity
- Files:
  - Default script folder
  - Autosave interval

Editing settings:
- Open Settings from the menu.

Advanced topics
---------------
Module mapping and require
- Nexus sets a local map for modules to simplify require calls.
- You can place modules in the default script folder and call require with the module name.
- The executor resolves names in the local map and loads the module code into the runtime.

Custom runtime wrappers
- For scripts that expect a custom executor API, write a small wrapper module that adapts the API.
- Place the wrapper in the module folder and require it at script start.

Performance tuning
- Reduce the number of active scripts for long runs.
- Use local modules to reduce repetitive loads.
- Increase thread priority in the settings if your system needs it.

Automation
- Add scripts to the startup folder to auto-run on attach.
- Use command-line flags in supported builds to run a script on launch.

Security and responsibility
